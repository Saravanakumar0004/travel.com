           <img class="img-fluid" src="img/India-Goa-Dudhsagar-Pavel-Vero-GettyImages-1150006110-RFC-crop.avif" alt="">
           <div class="content3">
            <p>India is a kaleidoscope of experiences, cultures, landscapes, cuisines and religions.</p><br>
            <p>Think it, and chances are, India has it. The country loves its monikers and is proud of its many superlatives. A salt desert. The largest river island. The world’s largest floating park. A village that disappears in the monsoon and reappears in summer. A park with white tigers. A city of lakes. These are but some of the unique experiences to be found in this country.</p><br>
            <p>As a traveler, you are best off picking a region or a state and dedicating time to exploring it in depth. It is not possible to soak in the incredible diversity of the country whose culture, language, and landscape changes every few miles in just one trip. This may require a few lifetimes.</p><br>
            <p>Unsure of where to start? Here are some of the highlights.</p><br>
           </div>

           <div class="content3">
            <h1 class="mt-5">1. Agra, Uttar Pradesh</h1><br>
            <p><b>Best city for lovebugs</b></p><br>
            <p>This historically rich city often forms part of India's most popular tourist circuit: The Golden Triangle, linking Delhi, Agra and Jaipur. Of course, the biggest reason to visit Agra is to see the Taj Mahal, one of the modern-day Seven Wonders of the World. Widely considered to be the greatest ever monument to love, it was constructed by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan as a tomb for his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal.</p><br>
            <p>The ivory-colored marble mausoleum sits in a complex that also includes gardens, two mosques and a museum. Further down the river is the spectacular Agra Fort, an expansive red sandstone structure famed for its monumental Delhi Gate and private palaces and mosques. Indeed, most of Agra’s historical landmarks are located close to each other on the banks of the Yamuna.</p><br>
            <p>The Taj is best seen at dawn or sunset, and the best views are across the river, from Mehtab Bagh Park. Agra is also famous for its petha, a sweet treat made from candied white gourd and often bought as a souvenir.</p><br>
            <p><b>Detour:</b> An hour’s drive away is another amazing historic site, Fatehpur Sikri – a ghost-haunted ruined city that was once the capital of the Mughal Empire under the emperor Akbar.</p>
           </div>

           <img src="img/GettyRF160094250.avif" alt="" class="img-fluid mt-5">
           <div class="content3">
            <h1 class="mt-5">2. Delhi</h1><br>
            <p><b>Best for history and architecture buffs</b></p><br>
            <p>India’s historic capital region forms the apex of the Golden Triangle. Delhi is a city and Union Territory, centred on Old Delhi – aka Shahjahanabad – and British-built New Delhi, India’s capital. Why visit? Well, if you walk almost anywhere in Old Delhi or New Delhi, you are likely to come across a historic building, ancient monument or timeworn tomb, mosque or fort.</p><br>
            <p>Topping the shortlist of must-sees are Mughal- and Delhi Sultanate-era buildings such as UNESCO World Heritage-listed Humayun’s Tomb in Nizamuddin, the Qutab Minar in south Delhi, the Jama Masjid and Red Fort in Old Delhi and the Jantar Mantar observatory in New Delhi. Also make time for the 1980s Bahai House of Worship (Lotus Temple) and India Gate, at the heart of Delhi's government district.</p><br>
            <p>Delhi is intense and chaotic but always interesting, and it's home to some of the finest cuisine (and street food) in the country. This is also a city that comes up trumps when it comes to entertainment – a visit to the bars and cafes of Hauz Khas Village in the evening will prove that point. And Delhi's markets – Karol Bagh, Janpath, Paharganj, Sarojini Nagar, Khan Market and Chandni Chowk – are great for picking up souvenirs and affordable fashions.            </p>

            <h1 class="mt-5">3. Darjeeling, West Bengal</h1><br>
            <p><b>Best for tea and toy trains</b></p><br>
            <p>The former summer capital of the British Raj, the hill station of Darjeeling is nestled in the lap of the Himalayas. Kanchenjunga (Khangchendzonga) – the world's third-highest mountain at 8586m (28,169ft) – looks benevolently over this town, with its silver fir forests, meandering roads, lush tea gardens and plunging valleys.</p><br>
            <p>As well as seeing relics of British colonialism, you can take a camping trek to the Singalila National Park, check out the Himalayan Mountaineering Institute (where Tenzing Norgay was once director), climb up to Tenzing Rock, shop and promenade on The Mall and sample some of India's finest brews at one of the city's many tea estates. For a more spiritual experience, find peace at the Japanese Peace Pagoda, the Ghum, Dali and Bhutia Busty Buddhist monasteries, or the Mahakal Temple on Observatory Hill (where Hindu and Buddhist deities reside together).</p><br>
            <p>The pride of Darjeeling is the tiny "toy train" that travels along the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway. This UNESCO World Heritage-listed railway runs downhill to New Jalpaiguri (NJP) to connect with trains from Kolkata, but most tourists focus on the short trip by steam locomotive between Darjeeling and Ghum.</p><br>
            <p><b>Detour:</b> a change of scene, there are more beautiful hill stations surrounding Darjeeling, such as Kalimpong, Kurseong, and Mirik – all accessible by shared 4WD.</p>

           <div class="content3">
            <h1 class="mt-5">4. Goa</h1>
            <p><b>Best for relaxation</b></p><br>
            <p>One of India’s smallest states, Goa is a top holiday spot thanks to its sun, sand, food, and vibes. Despite its small size, the state is culturally rich, with unique music, food, dance, and architecture, influenced by four centuries of Portuguese colonial rule. Get a glimpse of this heritage at the ruined basilicas of Old Goa, at centuries-old Goan homes such as Figueiredo House and Palácio do Deão, and at concerts of mando and fado music.</p><br>
            <p>Goa is blessed with a long, sandy coastline, and many activities here are centered on the beaches, from water sports to yoga. Step away from the sand and the hinterland reveals quiet villages with interesting local customs and festivals. Goa is also growing as a culinary destination, offering a taste of many different Indian and world cuisines and exciting new interpretations of local food.</p><br>
            <p><b>Local tip:</b> When choosing a Goa beach, North Goa has the parties and night markets, hippie culture, surfing schools, buzzing beaches and hip new cafes and bars. South Goa is known for its natural beauty, quiet beaches, wildlife sanctuaries such as Bhagwan Mahavir near Molem and Netravali near Palolem, and prehistoric sites such as Usgalimal.</p>

           <div class="content3">
            <h1 class="mt-5">5. Jaisalmer, Rajasthan</h1 ><br>
                <p><b>Best for desert romance</b></p><br>
                <p>Jaisalmer is India's city of gold, thanks to the gleaming color of its undulating sand dunes and sandstone buildings touched by the rays of the setting sun. The biggest attraction here is the living city inside Jaisalmer Fort. Inside, you will find havelis (traditional manors), royal palaces, timeless Hindu and Jain temples, and stalls selling an assortment of locally-made artifacts, accessories, jewelry and paintings.</p><br>
                <p>Away from the fort, Jaisalmer’s heritage can be explored in opulent historic homes such as Patwa’s Kotha Haveli (and museum), and on visits to the five-story Tazia Tower in the Mandir Palace complex. Also make time for the sandstone cenotaphs at Vyas Chhatri, and the ancient stone buildings around the Gadisar and Amar Sagar Lakes.</p><br>
                <p><b>Planning Tip:</b> The famous sand dunes are located on the outskirts of Jaisalmer, in the heart of the Thar desert. The Sam Sand Dunes and Khuri are the most popular spots, but overnight camel safaris that travel deeper into the desert will take you away from the crowds. For a comfortable overnight desert stay, book a night at one of the tented desert camps around Jaisalmer.</p>

           <div class="content3">
            <h1 class="mt-5">6. Kerala</h1><br>
            <p><b>Best for backwaters and beaches</b></p><br>
            <p>A lush paradise following India’s western coast, Kerala is blessed with beautiful beaches, placid backwaters, rich wildlife, myriad art forms and a diverse culture that more than justifies its celebrity status. But this steamy southern state offers more than just Ayurvedic massages. Onam, Vishu and other local festivals give a glimpse of the state’s rich culture, in the form of dance and music, cuisine, handicrafts and martial art forms. Try to catch a performance of Kathakali or Mohiniyattam dance.</p><br>
            <p>If you're lured to Kerala by the sand, the west coast is dotted with unspoiled beaches such as Kovalam and Varkala, while Alappuzha (Alleppey) is the gateway to backwater cruises by houseboat. To the east are hill stations such as Munnar, Wayanad and Thekkady, where tea, coffee and spice plantations grow luxuriantly across the hillsides. Sloth bears, Indian bison and tigers can be found in wildlife sanctuaries such as Mangalavanam Bird Sanctuary, Aralam, Neyyar, and Begur, and in national parks such as Periyar Tiger Reserve.</p><br>
            <p><b>Planning Tip: </b> visiting the historic port city of Kochi (Cochin), go during the Kochi-Muziris Biennale, a popular contemporary arts festival.</p>
           </div>

           <img src="img/GettyImages-1046313926.avif" alt="" class="img-fluid mt-5">
           <div class="content3">
            <h1 class="mt-5">7. Leh, Ladakh</h1><br>
            <p><b>Best for a taste of the mountain life</b></p><br>
            <p>A mystic land in the high Himalayas, Ladakh is blessed with stunning vistas, clear skies and dramatically picturesque mountain valleys. It is the ideal spot for anyone looking to rewind, digitally detox or connect with nature.</p><br>
            <p>You'll find adventure aplenty. You can trek into the lofty Markham and Nubra Valleys or attempt the climb up the highest trekkable peak in India, 6153m (20,187ft) Stok Kangri. Ladakh’s twisting roads offer a uniquely thrilling experience to those seeking an epic road trip, especially the crossing over the Khardung La pass on the highest motorable road in the world.</p><br>
            <p>Most people visiting Ladakh's ‘Little Tibet’ begin the journey in Leh – a capital city blessed with a cool, dry climate and significant religious sites such as the Shanti Stupa and towering Leh Palace. You can learn about Tibetan and Buddhist culture at Ladakh's many monasteries (try timeless Thiksey Gompa near Leh) or warm up with some traditional Ladakhi food – a unique mix of Indian, Tibetan and Nepalese culinary traditions.</p><br>
            <p><b>Planning tip:</b> Bear in mind that while summer is the best season to visit Ladakh, it is also the most crowded time in Leh. During winter, many parts of Ladakh are closed. Road travel to Leh from Manali or Srinagar is usually only possible from April to November when the high passes are clear of snow.</p>
           </div>

           <img src="img/GettyImages-1828082685.avif" alt="" class="img-fluid mt-5">
           <div class="content3">
            <h1 class="mt-5">8. Madhya Pradesh</h1><br>
            <p><b>Best for glimpses of tigers</b></p><br>
            <p>Madhya Pradesh sits in the heart of India – a vast territory known as the "tiger state" because of its tiger-stalked national parks, sanctuaries and reserves. It's tough to choose between the state's parks, which are famed for their successful conservation efforts. As well as tigers, Kanha Tiger Reserve is a good spot to see the endangered barasingha (swamp deer). Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve is famous for tiger sightings and Pench – which many believe was the inspiration for The Jungle Book – has rare black leopards. Indian giant squirrels find a home in Satpura, while Panna is home to seven endangered species of vultures.</p><br>
            <p>Definitely set aside time to visit the heritage site of Khajuraho, whose architecturally rich temples are famous for their erotic sculptures. Other worthy stops include the Buddhist pilgrimage site of Sanchi, and the rock shelters of Bhimbetka, showing traces of early life in India.</p>
           </div>

           <img src="img/shutterstock1084338836.avif" alt="" class="img-fluid mt-5">
           <div class="content3">
            <h1 class="mt-5">9. Meghalaya</h1><br>
            <p><b>Best for natural beauty  </b></p><br>
            <p>This ‘abode of the clouds’ in India’s often-overlooked northeast is a testament to the country's natural beauty. Meghalaya is blessed with thundering waterfalls, green hills and an extensive network of caves and lakes.</p><br>
            <p>It’s a region ideal for those who love adventure, enjoy trying new and exciting cuisines, and want to understand India's Adivasi (indigenous) culture. Definitely stop by the village of Mawlynnong near the Bangladesh border, billed as one of Asia's cleanest villages.</p><br>
            <p>The main attraction in the state is visiting the living root bridges created by the Khasi people, who coaxed the roots of Indian rubber trees to intertwine, forming natural bridges across rivers. Reaching these bridges, especially the famous double-decker root bridge near Nongriat, requires some cardiovascular exercise. You can find more of these beauties around Dawki and Cherrapunji (Sohra).</p><br>
            <p> <b>Planning tip:</b> Meghalaya is best explored towards the end of the monsoon when the rain is receding but waterfalls are still in full flow. Public transport isn’t great, so hire a car and driver to get around. </p>
           </div>

           <img src="img/shutterstockRF_1212004570.avif" alt="" class="img-fluid mt-5">
           <div class="content3">
            <h1 class="mt-5">10. Odisha</h1><br>
            <p><b>Best for temples, arts and crafts</b></p><br>
            <p>Odisha (formerly Orissa) is a state of many merits. As well as a rich religious heritage, it boasts good (if little-known) food, Indigenous arts and crafts, natural beauty, thriving wildlife and fascinating tribal culture. The history of Buddhism in India is also on display at more than 100 sacred sites and historic monuments.</p><br>
            <p>The highlights of any visit are the state's temples. Chief among them is the chariot-shaped Sun Temple at Konark, which is a marvel of Kalinga architecture. The coastal town of Puri is also home to major temples, including the Jagannath Temple, setting for a vast chariot festival known as Ratha Yatra in June or July.</p><br>
            <p>Different regions are popular for their arts and crafts. Cuttack is known for its silver filigree work, Raghurajpur for pattachitra (cloth painting) and Pipili for appliqué-work. Wildlife sanctuaries here offer different treasures – Gahirmatha is home to Olive Ridley turtles; Bhitarkanika shelters endangered saltwater crocodiles and herons; and Nandankanan has white and black (pseudo-melanistic) tigers.</p><br>
            <p><b>Planning tip:</b> There’s always a festival or fair happening in Odisha. Puri's Ratha Yatra attracts the biggest numbers, but the Konark Dance Festival in February and the Puri Beach Festival in November are popular too.</p>
           </div>

           <img src="img/India-Gujarat-Rann-chetansoni-shutterstock1142769881.avif" alt="" class="img-fluid mt-5">
           <div class="content3">
            <h1 class="mt-5">11. Rann of Kachchh (Kutch), Gujarat</h1>
            <p><b>Best for desert colors and silence</b></p><br>
            <p>This vast area of salt flats in the Thar Desert in Gujarat is one of the largest salt deserts in the world, and ideal for those who love photography and soaking in untouched natural beauty. The Rann of Kachchh (Kutch) is also where you go to find wildlife such as migrating flamingos and the endangered Indian wild ass. Both can be seen in the Kutch Desert Wildlife Sanctuary and the Wild Ass Sanctuary. Learn about the Kutchhi people who live here and their embroidery traditions, and explore the archaeological site of Dholavira. Each winter, the government hosts the Rann Utsav festival – a carnival of arts, folk dance and music.</p><br>
            <p><b>Detour: </b> major festival in the Thar Desert is the Pushkar Camel Fair in November, a huge annual camel fair accompanied by a multi-day cultural fête, held in the sacred town of Pushkar near Ajmer city in Rajasthan.</p>
           </div>

           <img src="img/LPT0410033.avif" alt="" class="img-fluid mt-5">
           <div class="content3">
            <h1 class="mt-5">12. Udaipur, Rajasthan</h1><br>
            <p><b>Best for some lake therapy</b></p><br>
            <p>Rajasthan loves its titles. If Jaipur is the Pink City, and Jodhpur is the Blue City, then Udaipur is the White City and the City of Lakes. It’s a befitting title for a city surrounded by seven lakes. </p><br>
            <p>There’s so much to do in this vibrant city. Take in the city view from the City Palace and trek up to the Sajjan Garh Monsoon Palace overlooking Fateh Sagar Lake. Or take a boat ride on Lake Pichola to admire the city's floating palaces – it may be touristy, but it's highly recommended. Udaipur also has its own ghats, of which Gangaur is the most popular.</p><br>
            <p>To see the city's spiritual side, marvel at the intricate sculptures covering the Jagdish Temple or take the ropeway to Karni Mata Temple, high above the lakeshore. By the water at Gangaur Ghat, Bagore Ki Haveli is a museum by day, and a performance venue by night – come here in the early evening to see traditional Rajasthani dances.</p><br>
            <p>Billed as a city of romance, Udaipur is a popular site for weddings, and if you're lucky, you may catch a baraat (bridegroom procession) or two while you're in town.</p><br>
            <p><b>Planning tip:</b> Udaipur is chock full of murals on its whitewashed walls. Set some time aside to wander the narrow streets and take in the intricate and colorful artwork and graffiti.</p>
           </div>

           <img src="img/GettyRF531163955.avif" alt="" class="img-fluid mt-5">
           <div class="content3">
            <h1 class="mt-5">13. Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh</h1><br>
            <p><b>Best for spirituality and street food</b></p><br>
            <p>Arguably India’s most sacred city, Varanasi (Benaras) is where you go for a dose of spirituality. Located on the banks of the holy River Ganges (Ganga), the city's riverside ghats are where thousands of pilgrims gather to bathe and seek redemption, cremate the dead and partake in rituals. You can observe the whole cycle of life and death play out on the banks of the river.</p><br>
            <p>The Ganga aarti ceremony, traditionally conducted at dusk, is an incredible visual spectacle. Many visitors also gather to watch – respectfully – the funeral services at Manikarnika Ghat. A walk through the city behind the ghats will introduce you to historic buildings such as Ramnagar Fort, the revered Kashi Vishwanath Temple, Alamgir Mosque and the Man Mandir Observatory. The Buddhist pilgrimage site of Sarnath, where the Buddha preached his first sermon, is a short drive outside the city.</p><br>
            <p>Varanasi also has a thriving street food culture. Its tangled lanes and bazaars are filled with vendors dishing out kachoris (fried stuffed pastries), chaats (savory snacks), jhal muri (puffed rice, vegetables and spices) and aloo puri (puffed flatbread with spiced potatoes).</p><br>
            <p class="pb-5"><b>Planning tip: </b> souvenirs unique to the region are Benarasi paan (betel nut for chewing, with dried dates) and the Benarasi saree, woven from local silk with fine silver or gold brocade.</p>
